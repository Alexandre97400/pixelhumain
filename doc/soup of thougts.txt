it's not about having a platform 
it's about philosophy, nad beleiving soemthing different is possible.
we are not convincing peolpe, they're allready aware of the need for change, 
we are merly following the status of the current collective intelligence 
going around on main stream web techs and aplied them to the way society works
The web has made it possible for us to share massively 
We've been building collaboratively , the web and computers for quite some time, 
and the open source world has made it happen
Let's try to apply the same energy to society.
Nothing can kill an open source project who's time has come.
