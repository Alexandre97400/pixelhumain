It was designed for an application where there are hundreds of elements that may show a context menu - so intialization speed and memory usage are kept fairly small. It also allows to register context menus without providing actual markup, as $.contextMenu generates DOMElements as needed.\n\n[features](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/index.html) - \n[demo](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html) - \n[documentation](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html)\n\n\n## Dependencies ##\n\n* jQuery >=1.8.2\n* jQuery UI position (optional but recommended)\n\n## Usage ##\n\nregister contextMenu from javascript:\n\n```javascript\n$.contextMenu({\n    // define which elements trigger this menu\n    selector: \".with-cool-menu\",\n    // define the elements of the menu\n    items: {\n        foo: {name: \"Foo\", callback: function(key, opt){ alert(\"Foo!\"); }},\n        bar: {name: \"Bar\", callback: function(key, opt){ alert(\"Bar!\") }}\n    }\n    // there's more, have a look at the demos and docs...\n});\n```\n\nhave a look at the [demos](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html).\n\n\n## HTML5 Compatibility ##\n\nFirefox 8 implemented contextmenu using the &lt;menuitem&gt; tags for menu-structure. The specs however state that &lt;command&gt; tags should be used for this purpose. $.contextMenu accepts both.\n\nFirefox 8 does not yet fully implement the contextmenu specification ([Ticket #617528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=617528)). The elements\n[a](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-a-element-to-define-a-command),\n[button](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-button-element-to-define-a-command),\n[input](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-input-element-to-define-a-command) and\n[option](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-option-element-to-define-a-command) \nusable as commands are being ignored altogether. It also doesn't (optically) distinguish between checkbox/radio and regular commands ([Bug #705292](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=705292)).\n\n* [contextmenu specs](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/interactive-elements.html#context-menus)\n* [command specs](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html)\n* [Browser support according to caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=context%20menu)\n\nNote: While the specs note &lt;option&gt;s to be renderd as regular commands, $.contextMenu will render an actual &lt;select&gt;. import contextMenu from HTML5 &lt;menu&gt;:\n\n```javascript\n$.contextMenu(\"html5\");\n```\n\n## Interaction Principles ##\n\nYou're (obviously) able to use the context menu with your mouse. Once it is opened, you can also use the keyboard to (fully) navigate it.\n\n* ↑ (up) previous item in list, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* ↓ (down) next item in, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* → (right) dive into sub-menu\n* ← (left) rise from sub-menu\n* ↵ (return) invoke command\n* ⇥ (tab) next item or input element, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* ⇪ ⇥ (shift tab) previous item or input element, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* ⎋ (escape) close menu\n* ⌴ (space) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus)\n* ⇞ (page up) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus)\n* ⇟ (page down) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus)\n* ↖ (home) first item in list, will skip disabled elements\n* ↘ (end) last item in list, will skip disabled elements\n\nBesides the obvious, browser also react to alphanumeric key strokes. Hitting <code>r</code> in a context menu will make Firefox (8) reload the page immediately. Chrome selects the option to see infos on the page, Safari selects the option to print the document. Awesome, right? Until trying the same on Windows I did not realize that the browsers were using the access-key for this. I would've preferred typing the first character of something, say \"s\" for \"save\" and then iterate through all the commands beginning with s. But that's me - what do I know about UX? Anyways, $.contextMenu now also supports accesskey handling.\n\n\n## Authors ##\n\n* [Björn Brala](https://github.com/swisnl)\n* [Rodney Rehm](https://github.com/rodneyrehm) (original creator)\n* [Christiaan Baartse](https://github.com/christiaan) (single callback per menu)\n* [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) (compatibility with native context menu in Firefox 8)\n\n\n## License ##\n\n$.contextMenu is published under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license)\n\n## Special thanks ##\n\nFont-Awesome icons used from [encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG).\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n### 2.3.0 ###\n\n#### Added\n\n* Asynchronous promise support for submenu's ([Issue #429](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/429)) thanks @Ruud-cb for the hard work.\n* Include dist and src in package.json to easily use SCSS files ([PR #467](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/pull/467))  thanks @RoachMech\n\n\n#### Fixed\n\n* Font family when using font awesome ([Issue #433](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/433))\n* Add check for `opt.$menu` is null when handling callbacks. ([Issue #462](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/462)) thanks @andreasrosdal\n\n#### Changed\n\n* Make `<input>` and `<select>` tags xhtml compatible ([Issue #451](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/451)) thanks @andreasplesch\n* Update jQuery UI position to 1.12.1\n\n#### Documentation\n\n* Fix demo for custom-command.

For now they overwrite root callbacks only if the item is not in a submenu, this so the callbacks are always correct. Unfortunately this will also mean the callbacks option is still not complete if you use the same key for an item in any place. Cant fix that easily. Issue #413.\n\n### 2.2.1 ###\n\n#### Added\n\n* Alias for 'cm_seperator' type: 'cm_separator' (thanks @nelson6e65)\n\n#### Changed\n\n* Removed old integration tests, framework on which they were built is abandoned.\n* Enable jQuery 3 tests in TravisCI\n\n#### Fixed\n\n* jQuery 3 support was fixed again, was a result of jQuery UI (Fixes #407)\n* Add checks for null before using opt.$menu and root.$menu.

Fixed by using outerwidth to calculate width. Fixes #360 (thanks @anseki)\n* Submenus are not collapsed when the menu is closed fixes #358 (thanks @anseki)\n* Small delay in checking for autohide to fix missing the menu by a pixel or two. Fixes #347 (thanks @Risord)\n* Check if an item is not hidden in any way when scrolling through items with the keyboard. Fixes #348\n* Change links and base url of documentation to https as mentioned by @OmgImAlexis in PR#345\n\n### 2.1.0 ###\n\n* Added support for providing a function as zIndex value in options object (thanks @eivindga)\n* Fixed a switch to use the correct type for separators (thanks @RareDevil)\n* Fixed the problem with submenus size wrongly ([Issue #308](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/308)) (thanks @RareDevil)\n* Incorrect entry on package.json ([Issue #336](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/336)) (thanks @Dijir)\n* Gray out disabled icons as well as text ([Issue #337](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/337)) (thanks @r02b)\n* Optimized generated CSS so that ``context-menu-icon`` class can be used to overwrite icon CSS.\n* Positioning of contextmenu when using appendTo (thanks @mrMarco)\n* Check to see if target have a higher zIndex than the contextmenu in the key event handler (thanks @RareDevil)\n\n###  2.0.1 (December 3rd 2015) ###\n\n* Remove executable bit from jquery.contextMenu.js (thanks @jacknagel)\n* Fixed a problem there was when using a function for icons (thanks @RareDevil)\n* Fixed a problem where submenus resized wrong (thanks @RareDevil)\n* Fixed a problem where the contextmenu would open another menu (thanks @RareDevil) - ([Issue #252](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/252) and [Issue #293](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/293))\n* Fixed regression of node name's not being appended to the label of input elements. (thanks @RareDevil)\n* Add check that root.$layer exists, to prevent calling hide() on an defined object. (thanks @andreasrosdal)\n\n\n### 2.0.0 (October 28th 2015) ###\n\n* __This version changes the default names of the icon classes in order to stop CSS conflicts with frameworks which define the class 'icon'.__ In order to keep the icon names the same as before this change you can change the defaults on the classnames for the icons ([docs on classNames option](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html#options-classNames)). The classnames will probably be \"context-menu-icon-*\" as proposed earlier by @rodneyrehm.\n* You can not use SASS to customize your contextmenu. The gulp command build-icons takes all the SVG icons from src/icons and builds them into a font. In order to this we needed to break backwards compatibility. This does mean the new CSS does not have the old .icon class defined which makes it a lot more stable within CSS frameworks. The first revision of the documentation is found [here](documentation/docs/customize.md).\n* The 1.x branch will be maintained for a while with bugfixes. But support for 1.x will be dropped in the coming months.\n* Reverted the change from 1.7.0: .html() changed back to .text() since it is an security issue (thanks @arai-a)\n\n### 1.10.1 (October 25th 2015) ###\n\n* Added gulp command (integration-test-paths) to change the paths in the integration tests to the correct path after they are overwritten by the documentation generator.\n* Make sure the contextmenu is not outside the client area by (thanks to @arai-a)\n* Update jQuery dependecy so that it will not result in double installation of jQuery when using npm (thanks to @fredericlb)\n\n### 1.9.1 (October 11th 2015) ###\n\n* Fixed a bug where the classNames options would fail on a submenu.\n* New documentation site and generation using [couscous](https://github.com/CouscousPHP/Couscous)\n\n### 1.9.0 (October 1st 2015) ###\n\n* Make classes configurable for those that can easily conflict. See the [docs on classNames option](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html#options-classNames). This also prepares to change classnames to non conflicting defaults so the hassle with frameworks as bootstrap will stop.\n* Fix for handling of seperator string. It threw an error on the protected property of String.$node\n* Fix for opening the contextmenu at coordinate 0,0 (by [Andreme](https://github.com/andreme))\n* Fixed check for jQuery UI ([Issue #182](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/182))\n* Updated doc for function argument for icon\n\n### 1.8.1 (September 14th 2015) ###\n\n* Updated readme.\n* Updated dist files\n\n### 1.8.0 (September 14th 2015) - dist files not updated! ###\n\n* Added dist folder with compiled JS and CSS, added these files to package and bower configuration.\n* Fixed doc link for jQuery UI position ([Issue #274](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/274))\n* Item icon can now be a callback to dynamically decide on icon class. - ([Issue #158](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/158), [Issue #129](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/129), [Issue #151](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/151), [Issue #249](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/249))\n* Small fix to calculating width and height on screen edges when padding is present.\n\n### 1.7.0 (August 29th 2015) ###\n\n* Touch support optimisations (by kccarter76) \n* changed .text to .html so there are no extra span's fixed - ([Issue #252](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/252))\n* added visibility callback to item definition\n* copy the HTML5 icon attribute when creating from HTML5 elements \n* growing menu when opening multiple times fixed - ([Issue #197](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/197))\n* fixed failure to run tests\n\n### 1.6.8 (August 18th 2015) ###\n\n* changes for new maintainer\n\n### 1.6.7 (May 21st 2015) ###\n\n* looking for maintainer note\n* publish to npm\n\n### 1.6.6 (July 12th 2014) ###\n\n* fixing bower manifest\n\n### 1.6.5 (January 20th 2013) ###\n\n* fixing \"opening a second menu can break the layer\" - ([Issue #105](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/105))\n\n### 1.6.4 (January 19th 2013) ###\n\n* fixing [jQuery plugin manifest](https://github.com/swisnl/jQuery-contextMenu/commit/413b1ecaba0aeb4e50f97cee35f7c367435e7830#commitcomment-2465216), again. yep.
